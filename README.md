# Full Stack Interview Take Home Project

The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate core competencies using Angular.

We will create a re-usable component library and publish it to npmjs.org.

Once the component is created we will then be able to `npm install` it in a separate 
angular environment and display it.

## 1. Library Requirements

Create a modal manager that allows you to `open(..)` multiple modal dialogs.

* Expose a service with an `open(..)` and `close(..)` method.
* Support more than one modal dialog being open at any time.
* Allow the caller to pass in a component reference which is dynamically injected.
* Return an Observable that will emit button click events.
* Should have basic scss styling.
* Test coverage should cover the service and component layers.

## 2. Example Application Requirements

Once you've published your angular component library module install it in a new angular project.

* Import the module.
* Open multiple modal dialogs in your `AppComponent` constructor.
* Use `setTimeout` or `setInterval` to randomly open and close multiple modal dialogs.
* Create a few components and pass them to your `open(..)` method of your modal service.
